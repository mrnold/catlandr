Cat Lander is a game inspired by this "Cats in Space" programming contest:
http://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10921

How to play:
 - Avoid the exuberant moon cat long enough to land and deliver its meal.

Keys:
 - Left, right: fly left or right until you find the flat landing zone.
 - Up, down: either one keeps you in the air. Land gently!
 - Exit: quit the game immediately.
 - F1: show the menu.
 - F2: generate a new moon (only works when the menu is showing).
 - 2ND: drop a cat treat to slow down the moon cat for two seconds.

Tips:
 - The line at the top of the screen is a fuel gauge. Don't run out of gas!
 - Treats must be placed directly in the moon cat's path for it to eat them.
 - Touching the surface will not automatically destroy the lander.

How to build (currently Windows only):
 - Get SDCC version 3.4.0
 - Get Python 2.7
 - Run build.bat from a command prompt
